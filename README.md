# Turborepo with Shadncn/UI

## How to use

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `yarn` to install dependencies
3. Run `yarn dev` to start the development server
4. Build your project. Use `yarn add:component` to add a new component from the shadcn/ui library

note: client components cause build errors right now. Will solve it when there's bandwidth.
